INSTALLING FUNDS

The latest version of funds is available at 
http://common-lisp.net/project/funds.

Funds is designed to be loaded with asdf, available from
http://cclan.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/cclan/asdf/asdf.lisp.
Make a symbolic link to the file funds/src/funds.asd somewhere visible
to asdf.  On linux, the command would be:

    prompt $ cd /somewhere/in/*central-registry*
    prompt $ ln -s /path/to/funds/src/funds.asd .

LOADING FUNDS

To load the system, type at a lisp prompt:

    > (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'funds)

To see the publicly exported symbols in package "FUNDS," look at the
file funds/src/package.lisp.  

SEEING THE EXAMPLES

Make a symbolic link to the file funds/examples/funds-examples.asd visible
to asdf.  Type (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'funds-examples).  Now try
(solve p1) to see a functional sudoku solver at work.
